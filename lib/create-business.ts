/**
 * Get-or-create the business row for `data.owner_id`.
 *
 * A given owner must own exactly one business row. Two signup paths can each
 * try to create one for the same owner — app/(auth)/register/actions.ts
 * right after signUp(), and app/auth/callback/route.ts after email / OAuth
 * confirmation — and a double-submitted register form adds a third racer.
 * When more than one row lands, app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx still renders
 * (it reads with .order(created_at).limit(1)) so the sidebar looks fine,
 * while every page that queries businesses-by-owner with a bare
 * .maybeSingle() gets a "multiple rows" result and renders blank, with
 * nothing in the logs (issue #5).
 *
 * The check-then-insert here is NOT atomic on its own: two racers can both
 * pass the pre-check and both attempt the INSERT. Once migration 036's
 * UNIQUE (owner_id) is in place the loser then gets a 23505 — which the
 * user must never see. So on ANY unique violation we re-read the owner's
 * row (retrying a few times: the winner's INSERT may have committed
 * microseconds ago and not be visible yet on this pooled connection) and
 * hand that back. Only the slug UNIQUE additionally gets a suffix retry.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT use INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (owner_id) DO NOTHING:
 * an install that runs this build before applying migration 036 has no
 * such constraint yet, and the ON CONFLICT clause would itself error.
 * Plain INSERT + recover-by-reselect works with or without the constraint.
 *
 * Returns the row's id, or null if creation genuinely failed (caller then
 * shows a retry prompt rather than dropping into a broken session).
